128 and 256 bits (16 or 32 bytes)
Unicode is an information technology (IT) standard for the consistent encoding,
representation, and handling of text expressed in most of the world's writing systems.
Unicode charector set
Unicode Transformation Format UTF-8	
Universal Coded Character Set (UCS)
A character in UTF8 can be from 1 to 4 bytes long. 
UTF-8 can represent any character in the Unicode standard.
UTF-8 is backwards compatible with ASCII. 
UTF-8 is the preferred encoding for e-mail and web pages
ord()-returns the ordinal value of its argument.
ord() function in Python accepts a string of length 1 as an argument and returns the unicode code point representation of the passed argument.
For example ord('B') returns 66 which is a unicode code point value of character ‘B’. 
The first 128 Unicode code point values are the same as ASCII
The chr() function in Python accepts an integer which is a unicode code point and converts it into a string representing a character.
chr(47) out put: /

non pritable ascii values : 0 to 31

ord
string --> unicode(ascii)
chr
unicode(ascii) --> string

Code Points
A code point is the value that a character is given in the Unicode standard.
The values according to Unicode are written as hexadecimal numbers and have a prefix of U+.
