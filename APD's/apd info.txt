Steganography is the practice of hiding private 
or sensitive information within something that appears to be nothing out to the usual

This technique is chosen, because this system includes not only imperceptibility 
but also un-delectability by any steganolysis tool.

Steganography is a technique of hiding information in digital media.
In contrast to cryptography, it is not to keep others from knowing the hidden information,
but it is to keep others from thinking that the information even exists.
Scope:-
a combination of cryptographic encryption and steganography encryption for its implementation
overview
The word steganography comes from the Greek
 “Seganos”,which mean covered or secret and – “graphy” mean writing or drawing. 
Therefore, steganography means, literally, covered writing

message (plain text, cipher text, other image, or anything)
an image to a computer is just a stream of bytes.
Each byte is composed of 8-bits, and each bit is capable of storing one value,
 either ‘0’ or ‘1’ which we all know as ASCII standard. 
The ASCII standard is an 8-bit character set which has 256 (28 ) characters that form text. Among those 256 characters, only few are readable and printable

process:-
The last bit of each interpreted byte of all the pixels is replaced with one bit of information that is to be inserted. 
In the same way, each and every bit of information that are be hidden is inserted into available pixels of the cover image till the end of information.
